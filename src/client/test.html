The death of her mother while she was doing charity work overseas and her father's single-minded focus on his business meant that Kate learned to chart her own course early on in life. Sometime after her mother died, Kate was attacked in Central Park during a nighttime walk, and while the precise nature of this attack has never been clearly stated, it is implied that she was sexually assaulted. Turning her sense of grief, shame and helplessness towards positive ends, Kate began a rigorous training regimen, schooling herself in the arts of archery, fencing, sword fighting, self defense, and several other types of combat, all in an attempt to prepare herself against such an attack in the future and prevent it from happening to others.</p><p>Kate met the <a href="/young-avengers/4060-40426/" data-ref-id="4060-40426">Young Avengers</a> during her older sister's wedding when gunmen took the entire church hostage. Her quick thinking played a large part in the gunmen's defeat when things took a bad turn for the Young Avengers. Afterwards, Kate met<a href="/stature/4005-40516/" data-ref-id="4005-40516">Cassie Lang</a> and the two became quick friends, traveling to the ruins of Avengers Mansion and joining the team.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Kate Bishop was created by <a href="/allan-heinberg/4040-40596/" data-ref-id="4040-40596">Allan Heinberg</a> and<a href="/jim-cheung/4040-2256/" data-ref-id="4040-2256">Jim Cheung</a> and appeared along with the other Young Avengers, with the exception of<a href="/speed/4005-40518/" data-ref-id="4005-40518">Speed</a> and the young Vision, in<a href="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/young-avengers-1-sidekicks-part-1/4000-103870/">Young Avengers Vol.1 issue 1</a> (2005).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Joining the Young Avengers</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4601541-young_avengers_vol_1_10_textless+%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4601541" data-ratio="1.4975041597338" data-width="601" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 601px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:149.8%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4601541-young_avengers_vol_1_10_textless+%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4601541"><img alt="Kate and the Young Avengers" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/4601541-young_avengers_vol_1_10_textless+%281%29.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4601541-young_avengers_vol_1_10_textless+%281%29.jpg 601w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/4601541-young_avengers_vol_1_10_textless+%281%29.jpg 427w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" data-width="427"></a><figcaption>Kate and the Young Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>Kate stayed with the team even when they were threatened by <a href="/kang/4005-2264/" data-ref-id="4005-2264">Kang the Conqueror</a>. Kate's father is very wealthy and she used this money to get new uniforms for the team after their originals were confiscated by<a href="/captain-america/4005-1442/" data-ref-id="4005-1442">Captain America</a> and<a href="/iron-man/4005-1455/" data-ref-id="4005-1455">Iron Man</a>, while Kate was a major driving force in keeping the team active and afloat after being shut down by the older heroes.

Impressed and somewhat humbled by Kate's words, Captain America gave her the codename Hawkeye and<a href="/hawkeye/4005-1475/" data-ref-id="4005-1475">Clint Barton</a>'s bow and arrows, along with his blessing.</p><h3>Civil War and Beyond</h3><p>Kate and the rest of the Young Avengers were aligned with Captain America's forces, after the Secret Avengers freed them from the custody of SHIELD's Capekiller units. Alongside the rest of the team, the new Hawkeye traveled to LA during the conflict to assist the Runaways, and the two teams would join forces against the threat of the Warden and Marvel Boy. Kate was disappointed by her friend <a href="/stature/4005-40516/" data-ref-id="4005-40516">Stature</a>'s decision to register with the government after the death of<a href="/goliath/4005-3470/" data-ref-id="4005-3470">Goliath</a>, but remained supportive of her friend, and the two parted fairly amicably. Also during the conflict, she, Patriot and the new Vision encountered<a href="/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/" data-ref-id="4005-40470">Bucky</a> for the first time, and assisted him in bringing down a cell of<a href="/hydra/4060-3480/" data-ref-id="4060-3480">HYDRA</a>, an experience she would remember vividly months afterward.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47589/1677377-bishop_civilwar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1677377" data-size="medium" data-ratio="1.1291512915129" data-width="813" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 813px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:112.9%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47589/1677377-bishop_civilwar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1677377"><img alt="Civil War" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" data-width="850" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47589/1677377-bishop_civilwar.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47589/1677377-bishop_civilwar.jpg 813w"><noscript><img alt="Civil War" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47589/1677377-bishop_civilwar.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47589/1677377-bishop_civilwar.jpg 813w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" data-width="850"></noscript></a><figcaption>Civil War</figcaption></figure><p>Following the victory of Iron Man's forces in the Civil War, Hawkeye remained with the rebel superheroes, often teaming up with Patriot while on patrol. Shortly before the funeral of Captain America, Hawkeye and Patriot were confronted by Clint Barton, the original Hawkeye (at the time dressed in Cap's uniform and bearing his shield). Unaware of his true identity, Kate lambasted him for usurping the name and costume of Captain America and acting as a puppet of the United States government. In the process, she explained that she had chosen the name of Hawkeye not to replace the original, but to honor him, and would act accordingly as he might have. Stunned by this revelation, Barton let the two Young Avengers go, even referring to Kate as Hawkeye before abandoning Iron Man to join <a href="/luke-cage/4005-1450/" data-ref-id="4005-1450">Luke Cage</a>'s<a href="/new-avengers/4060-42520/" data-ref-id="4060-42520">New Avengers</a>.</p><p>Kate would continue to have many adventures with the team, including helping Patriot locate Bucky once more (as well as take down an <a href="/aim/4060-13497/" data-ref-id="4060-13497">AIM</a> base in the process), and helping her close friend Stature after she accidentally injured her father in a fight with the<a href="/growing-man/4005-2266/" data-ref-id="4005-2266">Growing Man</a>. As time passed, she and Eli would continue to grow fond of one another, and they eventually went out on a date in Central Park. Unfortunately, the date turned out to be a disaster, as Kate, still uncertain of her feelings, rebuffed Eli's suggestion that they form an official relationship. Meanwhile, the impromptu ambush and sparring session initiated by<a href="/ronin/4005-41928/" data-ref-id="4005-41928">Ronin</a> (actually Clint Barton in disguise), didn't help matters. Accepting Ronin's offer to meet at the headquarters of the New Avengers, Kate was shocked to discover that he was Barton, back from the dead, and that he had called her there to test her worthiness of bearing the Hawkeye mantle. Losing out both the name and the bow in an archery contest with Barton, Kate eventually took up Speed's offer of a date and a mission to steal the bow back from the Avengers. While she did manage to retrieve the bow, her theft did not go unnoticed by Barton, who saw this as a sign that Kate was willing to stand up for what she believed in, and would not back down in the face of a challenge. Officially giving his blessing to her using the Hawkeye name and bow, as well as promising to let her run the Young Avengers as she saw fit, Barton followed it up with a present: an old picture of the Avengers back from the "Kooky Quartet" days. Now validated as Hawkeye, Kate ended up choosing Patriot over Speed, asking her teammate to be patient with her and give her some time.</p><h3>Secret Invasion</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123851/2722186-447598_secret_invasion_gabriele_dell_otto04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2722186" data-size="small" data-ratio="1.5180722891566" data-width="1577" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1577px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:151.8%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123851/2722186-447598_secret_invasion_gabriele_dell_otto04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2722186"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px" data-width="421" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/123851/2722186-447598_secret_invasion_gabriele_dell_otto04.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123851/2722186-447598_secret_invasion_gabriele_dell_otto04.jpg 1577w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/12/123851/2722186-447598_secret_invasion_gabriele_dell_otto04.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/123851/2722186-447598_secret_invasion_gabriele_dell_otto04.jpg 632w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/123851/2722186-447598_secret_invasion_gabriele_dell_otto04.jpg 421w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/123851/2722186-447598_secret_invasion_gabriele_dell_otto04.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123851/2722186-447598_secret_invasion_gabriele_dell_otto04.jpg 1577w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/12/123851/2722186-447598_secret_invasion_gabriele_dell_otto04.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/123851/2722186-447598_secret_invasion_gabriele_dell_otto04.jpg 632w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/123851/2722186-447598_secret_invasion_gabriele_dell_otto04.jpg 421w" sizes="(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px" data-width="421"></noscript></a></figure><p>During the <a href="/skrulls/4060-40668/" data-ref-id="4060-40668">Skrull</a> invasion, Hawkeye and the Young Avengers were the first superheroes on the scene, and despite their best efforts, along with those of the<a href="/camp-hammond/4020-42789/" data-ref-id="4020-42789">Camp Hammond</a><a href="/the-initiative/4060-42781/" data-ref-id="4060-42781">Initiative</a> recruits, they were eventually defeated by the superior number and firepower of the Skrulls.

Unfortunately, Kate's problems with the "Young Masters" are only just beginning, as the Executioner uses his new found revelation of Kate's secret identity to blackmail his way onto the Young Avengers. While she rejects Wiccan's suggestion to have his memory altered, Hawkeye remained very concerned about the situation, feeling that the presence of the Young Masters will only serve to corrupt them and ruin their good intentions.</p><p>In order to cast doubt on the Executioners' knowledge of her secret identity, Kate and the rest of the Young Avengers staged a mock supervillain battle at a gala event she would be publicly attending in her civilian persona, with the Executioner (in his civilian persona), as her date. During the evening, in front of the entire media, the Young Avengers stormed in chasing a supervillain (in reality, Wiccan under an illusion spell), including "Hawkeye" (in reality, the Vision disguising himself with a hologram), stopping to compliment Kate's choice of gown on the way. The next day, when confronted by the ashamed and angry Executioner, Kate mocked him by telling him his mother was a supervillain, something he didn't even know himself. This, as well as many other issues the Young Masters faced, who result in them turning to Norman Osborn and his Dark Avengers for help, luring the Young Avengers into a trap when they next met in the Invisible Mansion. During the battle that followed, Hawkeye confronted her villainous counterpart in the Dark Avengers, Bullseye, even holding her own against both him and the Executioner simultaneously before Bullseye is shot by the Executioner for mentioning his mother. With the disappearance of the Young Masters, the threat to Kate's secret identity seems to have lessened for now, and Hawkeye continues to have adventures with the team.</p><h3>Siege and the Heroic Age</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4601536-41-eli-katedr5-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4601536" data-ratio="0.52" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 600px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:52.0%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4601536-41-eli-katedr5-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4601536"><img alt="Kate and Patriot agains Dark Avengers" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/148344/4601536-41-eli-katedr5-2.jpg" data-srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4601536-41-eli-katedr5-2.jpg 600w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/148344/4601536-41-eli-katedr5-2.jpg 480w"><noscript><img alt="Kate and Patriot agains Dark Avengers" src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/148344/4601536-41-eli-katedr5-2.jpg" srcset="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4601536-41-eli-katedr5-2.jpg 600w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/148344/4601536-41-eli-katedr5-2.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kate and Patriot agains Dark Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>As Norman Osborn's forces begin their siege of Asgard, Captain America rallies the New Avengers, Young Avengers and Secret Warriors to launch a counterattack against the tyrant.

After discovering that Scarlet Witch is with<a href="/doctor-doom/4005-1468/" data-ref-id="4005-1468">Dr Doom</a> in<a href="/latveria/4020-41031/" data-ref-id="4020-41031">Latveria</a>, Wiccan teleports himself to Dr Doom's castle against the wishes of the team, who pursue him there. When the Young Avengers arrive in Latveria, Kate is keen to limit the mission to simple search and rescue and suggests the need for a distraction. At that moment Wonder Man and also the Avengers show up, both in pursuit of Scarlet Witch (the Avengers looking for Wiccan too). Just as the team are about to embark on their rescue plan they are confronted by the Avengers and immediately get embroiled in a pitched battle with Dr Doom and some of his robots.<a href="/wolverine/4005-1440/" data-ref-id="4005-1440">Wolverine</a> directly attacks Wanda, trying to kill her but is stopped by Wiccan and the surprising arrival of<a href="/iron-lad/4005-2263/" data-ref-id="4005-2263">Iron Lad</a> on the scene. Later, whilst fighting Doom, the Young Avengers suffer a double tragedy; both Cassie and Jonas perish in the final battle. As a result of this, Kate leaves the group and the Young Avengers disband. The team is invited to the Avenger's Mansion some months later, and Kate along with the other surviving members of the Young Avengers are officially announced as honorary Avengers.</p><h3>The New Hawkeye</h3><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/2696588-kate_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-null" data-ratio="0" data-width="0" data-embed-type="image"><a  href="https://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/2696588-kate_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-null"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/2696588-kate_3.jpg"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/2696588-kate_3.jpg"></noscript></a></figure><p>Kate has temporarily joined up with the previous Hawkeye, Clint Barton in his solo series.
